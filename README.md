This project implements a **Checkers AI** that autonomously plays both sides using **Alpha-Beta Pruning**. It reads an initial board state from a file, calculates the best sequence of moves until the game ends, and writes each board state along the way to an output file.

---

## What it does

- Alpha-Beta pruning with a configurable depth limit (default: 7)
- Enforces **mandatory jumps** and supports **chained jumps**
- Handles **piece promotion** (kinging)
- Plays both red (`r`/`R`) and black (`b`/`B`) sides
- Strategy-aware behavior:
  - Wins **as fast as possible** when a win is guaranteed
  - **Delays loss** when defeat is unavoidable

---

## Input Format

The AI expects a text file containing an 8×8 board like this:

.......b  
..r...b.  
........  
R...b.b.  
........  
..r.....  
...r....  
....B...  

where b is black and r is red. Each empty space is indicated by a dot. Kings are indicated by 
capital letters.

## Output Format

The output is a text file showing the full move sequence, where each board state is separated by a blank line.

.......b  
..r...b.  
........  
R...b.b.  
........  
..r.....  
...r....  
....B...  

.......b  
..r...b.  
........  
R...b.b.  
.r......  
........  
...r....  
....B...  

... (more moves) ...

## Usage

### 1. Prepare an input file

Save your board configuration to a file like `input.txt`.

### 2. Run the solver

```bash
python checkers_ai.py --inputfile input.txt --outputfile output.txt


## Configuration

To increase or decrease search depth, change this variable at the top of the file: depth_limit
